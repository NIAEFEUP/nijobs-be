# API Documentation

This folder contains the documentation website code.

To edit the contents, simply edit the .md files in `docs/`

This uses Docusaurus, so for any question, check their docs (https://v2.docusaurus.io/)

## Previewing

This is just a react website, so you can run `npm install` and `npm start` and it will launch it by default at localhost:3000
