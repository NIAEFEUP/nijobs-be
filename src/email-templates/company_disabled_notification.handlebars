<p>Hello {{companyName}},</p>
<br>
<p>This email is being sent to inform you that your company account has been disabled.</p>
<p>As such, your offers have all been hidden, making them invisible to users.</p>
<p>This is a temporary state, so you or a user with admin privileges can re-enable your account at any time. 
    As soon as that is done, all the offers created by you that would be public at that time will be made visible again.</p>
<br>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>NIJobs team at NIAEFEUP</p>
